# LeaseHub
LeaseHub is an Android application that provides an easy solution to maintain and organise property rent agreements.
I have used Android Studio to develop this application that uses Firebase as its real time database.
It not only limited to maintain the agreement, but also provide an easy communication between the Tenant and Landlord.
